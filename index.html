      <h1 id="cybersecurity-portfolio">Greeting !!</h1>
<p>Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio! This portfolio is a collection of my journey in cybersecurity, showcasing my skills, projects, and hands-on experience in keeping the digital world secure. From analyzing threats to tackling security challenges, Iâ€™m always exploring and learning.
    <br><br>Dive in to see my work, and feel free to connectâ€”letâ€™s talk all things cyber! ðŸš€
</p>

<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
<p>Hey there, it's Logeshwar! I'm all about cybersecurity and keeping the digital world safe. You could say I'm a bit of a cybersecurity enthusiast. I'm super passionate about making sure our online spaces are secure and protected from all those cyber baddies out there.

    <br><br>Whether it's diving into the nitty-gritty of threat detection or analyzing security incidents, I'm all in. I love staying on top of the latest trends and technologies in the cybersecurity realm because, let's face it, it's always evolving, and there's always something new to learn.
    
    <br><br>So, if you're into cyber stuff too, or just curious about how to keep your digital life locked down tight, let's chat! I've got experience in hacking platforms and navigating the cybersecurity landscape, so I'm here to help. Feel free to drop me a line via the contact section below, and let's connect!</p>


<strong>Background</strong>: I graduated with a B.E. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE) in 2024, though letâ€™s be realâ€”my degree has little to do with what I actually love doing. Turns out, cybersecurity and coding stole my attention more than circuits ever could. But hey, passion beats relevance, right?<br><br>
<strong>Interests</strong>: I'm deeply interested in cybersecurity, coding, AI agents, and blockchain. Whether it's breaking into (and securing) systems, exploring decentralized tech, or experimenting with AI-driven security tools, I'm always up for the challenge.<br><br>
<strong>Hobbies</strong>: When I'm not deep into security research, you'll find me watching football (huge passion), playing video games, binge-watching anime, or travelingâ€”because even cybersecurity nerds need a break sometimes</p>
